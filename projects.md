<img src="images/medical/ApplicationsofElastography/Screenshot_2.png?raw=true"/>
Advanced research applying deep learning techniques to ultrasound in both medical and non-destructive testing.working on image analysis and segmentation Next i ll explore 
-   how to increase ultrasound images resolution using Deep learning techniques.
-   how to segment and classify organs in ultrqsound images.
-   how to classify different types of defects in NDT images.
-   IMPLEMENTING super resolution techniques to increase ultrasound images resolution KEEP THAT IN MIND

### Marinex: Open Source Marine Charts
<img src="images/Marine/1.jpg?raw=true"/>

Working on creating my own open source solution for marine navigation chart visualization. Built with modern web technologies for optimal performance.
Still a work in progress. i gathering information and looking for collaborators.that will help me to make this project a reality.
don't hesitate to contact me if you are interested in collaborating. 
i have valuable bathymetric data that i want to explore and visualize. ill be testing the project and work to get this piece of software on every boat out there.
