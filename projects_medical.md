Advanced research applying deep learning techniques to ultrasound in both medical and non-destructive testing.working on image analysis and segmentation Next i ll explore 
-   how to increase ultrasound images resolution using Deep learning techniques.
-   how to segment and classify organs in ultrqsound images.
-   how to classify different types of defects in NDT images.
-   IMPLEMENTING super resolution techniques to increase ultrasound images resolution KEEP THAT IN MIND
